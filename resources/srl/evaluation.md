Evaluation is one aspect of metacognition, in which students figure out how well you learn. Students who self-evaluate also tend to think about what worked well and how they can improve, which could help them avoid mistakes and can let them know when you might need to adjust their approach to learning and studying.

Here are a few strategies to suggest to your students, to help them become skillful self-evaluators:
* As you work on an assignment, ask yourself "Am I learning what I am supposed to?"
* After you complete an assignment, ask yourself, "What was the most important thing I learned?" and "What can I do better next time?"
* Keep a list of learning strategies that seem to work best for you.
