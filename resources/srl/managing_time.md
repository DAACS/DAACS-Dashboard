Going to college requires students to use effective time management strategies in order to manage multiple tasks and avoid becoming overwhelmed. Students who use time management strategies tend to work more efficiently, feel less stressed, and experience a greater level of confidence in school. 

These time management strategies are quite useful, which you could recommend to your students:
* Set aside regular times to complete your work and stick to your schedule.
* Prioritize your assignments: Make sure you complete the most important tasks first.
* Estimate the time it takes to complete assignments and then check to see how accurate you were.
