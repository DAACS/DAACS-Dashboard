Goal orientation refers to the reasons people engage in learning. Two types of goal orientation include mastery orientation and performance orientation. People with a mastery orientation want to master skills and gain knowledge. In contrast, people with a performance orientation want to perform well so they appear intelligent or capable to others. Most people have a combination of both types of goal orientation, but good learners tend to be more mastery oriented.

Offer these suggestions to your students to help them enhance their mastery orientation:
* Don't worry about how others perform; focus on your own growth and learning.
* Focus on your improvement and progress rather than a single grade.
* View mistakes and errors as opportunities to improve.
