Monitoring is one aspect of metacognition, in which students keep track of how well they learned or performed a task. Monitoring also means being aware of tasks that are challenging, or times when they are not performing at a desired level. Becoming more aware of their thinking can let them know when and how they might need to change up their study approaches to improve their learning.

Offer these strategies to your students to help them improve on their monitoring habits:
* Ask yourself these questions while you listen to lectures, read texts, and watch videos: "Am I learning the material? Is anything getting in the way of my learning?"
* Make two lists: One list of tasks that you do well, and another of tasks with which you struggle. Click on More Info for recommendations for dealing with the tasks on the second list.
