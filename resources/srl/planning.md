Planning is one aspect of metacognition, in which students think before taking action. When students think about the expectations for assignments, reflect on how to organize their work, and ask themsevles about the best ways to learn, they will often have an easier time completing activities.

Offer these suggestions to students to help them become a more effective planner:
* Ask yourself questions before you begin a learning activity: "What am I expected do? What approach to this work can help me do well?"
* Brainstorm multiple ways to approach an activity and then choose the best option.
* Ask your teachers questions about tasks and new material.
