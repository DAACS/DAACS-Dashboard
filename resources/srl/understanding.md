Students who perform well in college use a variety of learning strategies to understand new material. A strong repertoire of study strategies is valuable because different subjects require different approaches to learning.

Here are a couple of learning strategies you could recommend your students to try:
* Study course material over several short study sessions rather than one long session.
* Use practice quizzes or tests to check your understanding of course material. Restudy only the material you got wrong.
* Elaborate on information by using concept maps or making summaries.
